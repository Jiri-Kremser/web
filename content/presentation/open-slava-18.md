title: "Apache Spark on Kubernetes 2018"
description: "Have you ever wondered how to implement your own operator pattern for you service X in Kubernetes? You can learn this in this session and see an example of open-source project that does spawn Apache Spark clusters on Kubernetes and OpenShift following the pattern. You will leave this talk with a better understanding of how spark-on-k8s native scheduling mechanism can be leveraged and how you can wrap your own service into operator pattern not only in Go lang but also in Java. Let's make the data science more scalable in a cloud native fashion."
