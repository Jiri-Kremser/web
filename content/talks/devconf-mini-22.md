title: "log2rbac @ DevConf mini 22"
description: "If you have ever developed an operator pattern for Kubernetes, you have probably had to tweak your service account and assign it to a role. Setting up the RBAC correctly is not that hard, but it's not fun and it distracts you from the real problem the operator is about to solve. This often leads to assigning the cluster admin to the operator and neglecting the security altogether.

Log2rbac is a tool (yet another operator) that aims to solve this issue. It assists you with setting up your RBAC roles that are tailored for your application's needs. Come to see this talk and learn more."
