title: "Multi-Cloud Global Content Distribution at Cloud Native Speeds"
where: "OpenSourceSummit EU 24 @ Vienna"
description: "If you’ve been globally distributing digital content for a while, you’ll understand that merely having numerous datacenters with advanced caching patterns isn’t sufficient. When your users need to retrieve an object that’s available in different locations worldwide, they should ideally be directed automatically to the location that’s nearest and fastest for the best experience. Cloud service providers typically offer services to handle this for you within their own clouds, but what if you are running a multi-cloud or hybrid environment? K8GB is a cloud-native solution that handles GeoDNS across heterogeneous environments and enables you to reach the same level of multiregion service resilience offered by cloud providers."
