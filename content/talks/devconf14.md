title: "Writing an internal DSL language in Scala"
description: "Have you ever wanted to write your own programming language? Why not to start with much simpler task - writing some domain specific language. Since the Scala programming language is a great fit for creating internal DSL, we will utilize its functional nature and implicit conversions, and together we will create a fluent API in form of a DSL. 

Scala noob? No worries! No previous Scala experience is needed, all the techniques will be explained during the workshop. Itâ€™ll be piece of cake if you know any modern programming language. "
