title: "log2rbac Operator"
description: "Kubernetes operator that helps you to set up the RBAC rules for your application. If requested, it scans the application's log files for authorization errors and adds them as exceptions/rights to the associated {Cluster}Role. It is like having a sudo command for your service accounts. However, with great power comes great responsibility. The goal of the tool is to find the minimum set of rights that is needed for your workload to run instead of using the cluster admin for everything."
